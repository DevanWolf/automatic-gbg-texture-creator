This directory contains a snapshot of utilities that are needed for image analysis.

At this point I've just hosted a copy here for convenience but the original author
(to the best of my knowledge) is **Scrubz** from the **VideoDojo** community. At
time of writing, these utilities are being publicly shared in pinned posts. No
special permission was required and no license restrictions were communicated.
